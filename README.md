# Lab 8 - Starter
1) Option 1 seems best because this would be a form of incremental testing that would allow a team to catch any bugs as soon as the code is produce. While option 2 seems like a good option for exploring the tool, it would be much more efficient to automate it after understanding how the tool works. Option 3 sounds like a team could find out their code has many errors once they finish all development, which is not the best practice because it makes it harder to debug.
2) To test if a function returns the correct value, I would run a unit test as opposed to E2E because this has nothing to do with user behavior but rather  the logic behind our code.
